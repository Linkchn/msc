Mines OpenCL kernels from Github. Requires the following environment
variables to be set:

     GITHUB_USERNAME   github username
     GITHUB_PW         github password
     GITHUB_TOKEN      github api token

For instructions to generate an API token, see:

  <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/>

This process issues thousands of GitHub API requests per minute. Please
exercise restrained in minimizing your use of this program -- we don't
want to upset the nice folks at GH :-)
